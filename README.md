Cat Petting Simulator 2014
===============

Cat Petting Simulator 2014, alias "Cat Clicker"

Uses collie.js as game framework, require.js for loading, and
underscore.js for some helpers. Tries to be OOP-ish. This is very
obviously inspired by Cookie Clicker.

There are some TODOs scattered through the code, so you can
chime in and help along. Automation, upgrade and achievement ideas
as well as artwork are always welcome (I found out I am not good at
drawing anything but cats).
